    <p class="info">As an all round graphic designer my work is driven by passion for narrative design, i strongly believe
        that design is communication made visual. My process involves proper research and deep understanding of the clients vision.
        my goal is to create designs that will stand the test of time, design that will
        make people stop and stare. i draw inspiration from every form of art around me, using the positive
        and taking out the negative to create visuals. my philosophy is that good design should always be
        functional. through my designs, i aim to connect ideas in an impactful way.</p>
